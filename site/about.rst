About Platipy
=============

The overarching objective of the Platipy project is to provide tools and guides to develop educational games for the XO laptop. Our team wants to provide not just an educational experience for programmers, but also spur developers to create new, useful activities for children.
	
Specifically, our goals for this project are to develop and/or create the following tools:

    :Spyral: A pure-Pygame game development library. Offers a number of very powerful features, including automatic dirty rendering, actor-oriented programming (using greenlets), and a convenient API. Sits on top of Pygame completely, insulating the user from its intricacies.
    :Example.Activity: A template activity that greatly simplifies XO activity development. Contains powerful features for developing Spyral-based activities off the XO, including handling translations, game scaling for non-XO resolutions, and packaging the game for the XO and other platforms such as Windows and Mac. 
    :Platipy Docs: A complete guide for Python, XO activity, and Spyral development. Will also include a curated gallery of completed Spyral-based XO activities.
    :Conspyre: A networking server framework and client library for school-based XO distributions that provides data persistence (in case of students not being allowed to own XOs) and student/teacher communication (especially with bad network connections) with minimal developer work. Designed to work directly with Spyral and take advantage of its features.
    :Spur: A Scratch-to-Spyral game converter.
